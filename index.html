	<p>The binturong (/bɪnˈtuːrɒŋ/ bin-TOO-rong) (Arctictis binturong), also known as bearcat, is a viverrid native to South and Southeast Asia. It is uncommon in much of its range, and has been assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because of a declining population trend that is estimated at more than 30% over the last three decades.[1]</p>

	<p>Although called 'bearcat', this omnivorous mammal is neither related to bears nor cats but to the palm civets of Asia. It is a monotypic genus.[3] Its genus name Arctictis means ‘bear-weasel’, from Greek arkt- ‘bear’ + iktis ‘weasel’.</p>
	
	<p>In 1822, Thomas Stamford Raffles first described a specimen from Malacca.[5] In Riau, Indonesia it was known as tenturun.[6]</p>
